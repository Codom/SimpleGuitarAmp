# CLAP amp plugin

This plugin attempts to emulate a fender style tone stack with high amounts of
distortion. Other tone stacks can be implemented by modifying the filters being
used in render_audio.

Only supports the Clap C api.

Clap entrypoint and related metadata is in src/main.zig and the plugin
function pointers are located in src/plugin.zig.

## Building and Installing

To build, you need to install the Zig compiler and checkout this repository
and it's submodules.

### Linux

Navigate to the project root, and run the following
```
zig build
cp zig-out/lib/libvst.so ~/.clap/guitar_plugin.clap
```

### Windows/Mac

I haven't officially tested on windows and mac, however the process should
be the same as Linux
1. Setup [zig dev env](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/)
2. Run `zig build` in project
3. Move zig-out/lib/libvst.(so/dll) into the clap plugin directory as a .clap file
    - Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Common\CLAP\guitar_plugin.clap`
    - Mac `~/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/CLAP/guitar_plugin.clap`
